/* 
Write some JavaScript code, that is, variables and operators, 
to describe the following scenarios. 
Do not worry about the real operations to get the values, 
the goal of these exercises is to understand how 
real world conditions can be represented with code.
-------------------------
1. You have rented some movies for your kids: The little mermaid (for 3 days), 
Brother Bear (for 5 days, they love it), 
and Hercules (1 day, you don't know yet if they're going to like it). 
If price for a movie per day is $3, how much will you have to pay?

2. Suppose you're working as a contractor for 3 companies: Google, 
Amazon and Facebook, they pay you a different rate per hour. 
Google pays $400, Amazon $380, and Facebook $350. 
How much will you receive in payment for this week? 
You worked 10 hours for Facebook, 6 hours for Google and 4 hours for Amazon.

3. A student can be enrolled in a class only if the class is not full
and the class schedule does not conflict with her current schedule.

4. A product offer can be applied only if a person buys more than 2 items, 
and the offer has not expired. Premium members do not need to buy a specific 
amount of products.



//Use the following code to follow the instructions below:

var username = 'codeup';
var password = 'notastrongpassword';

/*
Create a variable that holds a boolean value for each of the 
following conditions:

-the password must be at least 5 characters
-the password must not include the username
-the username must be no more than 20 characters
-neither the username or password can start or end with whitespace
